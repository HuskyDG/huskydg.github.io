An app is used for downloading any Minecraft PE version (beta or stable) from Play Store.

The original version requires the Google account with Minecraft PE purchase license for downloading.

So the mod will trick Google Play Store server that your account has Minecraft PE purchase license, so your account don't have to buy Minecraft PE from Play Store for this. 

Minecraft PE will check for purchase license from Play Store. Because of this, you will have to bypass this by using Lucky Patcher
